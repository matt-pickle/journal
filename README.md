WHAT IT DOES
I wanted an app with a simple, clean, but stylish interface for journaling. Each user's entries are saved to the database under the current date. Previous entries can be viewed clicking the date of the entry in the navigation menu.

WHAT I LEARNED
Implementing a dark/light theme option
Using icons from FontAwesome.com
Styling a scroll bar in Firefox vs other browsers
Increased familiarity with the Context API
